pwd = print working directory
ls = list files
cd = change directory
cd .. = goes up a directory from your pwd
cd folder_name = navigates into sub-folder from your working directory

if your pwd is home, cd Desktop navigates you to Desktop
~ is the same as your home folder

ctrl + c to exit a process or unterminated string on the terminal (really helpful!)
touch
man ls     (to get the manual page on ls)
open filename.txt (uses the default application of Mac to open that type of file)
code filefile.txt (open up filename.txt in VS Code)
code .   (opens up the entire current working directory in VS Code)
mkdir directory_name



mv filetomove.txt destination

If we have hello.txt in Desktop
mv ~/Desktop/hello.txt ~/Documents/    (moves the hello.txt file from Desktop to Documents folder)

mv original_path destination_path  (generic form)
mv relative_path new_relative path

copying works exactly like move
cp original_path destination_path

renaming something on the commandline
mv original_path_name new_name


rm filename.txt

cat filename.txt (to see the contents)

man cat (check the manual page for cat)
